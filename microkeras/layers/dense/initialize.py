    Initialize the attributes of the dense layer.

    This method sets up the basic attributes of the dense layer, including the number of units,
    activation function, and input shape. It also initializes placeholders for weights, biases,
    and other attributes that will be set during the build and training process.

    Parameters:
    units (int): The number of neurons in the layer.
    activation (str or None): The activation function to use.
    input_shape (int or tuple): The shape of the input to this layer.
